# *Awesome-Reads* ![books](./static/images/book-clipart.png )

This book review project is aimed at anyone who enjoys reading and talking about what they have read. Viewing & reviewing books, saving them in a library/list for future use,
finding new books and Authors, reading other peoples reviews, reading qoutes from books they are interested in. I'm an avid reader and was pretty motivated 

## *UX*

The Website is fully responsive and is designed to be easy to navigate with little distraction. The item in navbar change if the user is logged in, limiting the content to a logged out user.Logged in users are able to Create, update (edit) and delete their own reviews. A user can also log out. A user can feel, relatively, at ease with a secure account. Mongo DB holds users information and reviews. The user is able to register and login and view other reviews.

Each review on the home page can be clicked onto and that will load the single review page which shows the entire entry. If the user created the review on their page they will be able to edit and delete the review, and also delete their profile when they need to.

The add review allows the logged in user to create a review and enter it onto the database.

## *Project Goals*  

The overall goal of the project was to allow users to review books and create/upload/update their own book reviews viewable.
As an avid reader I liked the idea of a social book hang out. Like club. But thats beyond the scope of this project for now.
The idea was and stll is a place for good books with a summary and reviews by others.

The wireframes can be found in the Docs folder in Static, I didnt chance loading them out here because they may be oversized.
The project, like always, changed along the way but still turned out more or less like the idea in mind.

### *Future Implementations

As stressful as these 2 weeks have been and how rushed the finished app is, as I type this I still really enjoyed the process. In the future version of this app it will be a 'Book Chat' app, that was the original plan along with GoodReads and sockets.. where users can continue uploading books and reviewing others collections, but also with instant chat using socket.io, and absolutely with an API such as GoodReads or the OpenLibrary to add more zest to the conversation and discovery.

The user profile I would have liked to have spent more time on, It was fun making it basic. I still feel like this app is very incomplete and maybebuggy so I do definitely do see it as pet project upon finishing the course with CI.

## *Features*

1. Register and Login - Flask_session 

2. Profile dedicated to the user with their own reviews

3. 

. More error handling and @login_required to make profiles and data more secure

4.

## *Technolgoies Used*

Flask
Flask Sessions
werkzeug.security
My Linux terminal, this time I only used the terminal to manage my project tree.
MongoDB
MONGODB GUI
Bootstrap
Virtualenv
GitHub
StackOverflow
YouTube
VsCode <3
DevTools - especially the responsive clicker.
& ATOM

## *Testing* 

First test after setting up I didnt connect to MONGO - square brackets instead of round on MONGO_URI

I used dummy data posts to check functionality.

Registration form wasn't rendering to the page - it was the way my route was set.

During development of my first MS3 I encountered quite a few errors, more than I can count actually. Mainly with globally installed files packages that were effecting my project workspace. I ended up having to restart the project 3 times over the last 2 weeks. The issue was down to me messing with other packages in a different workspace and not being aware of installing python packages globally and the effects it can have on the system. - I ended up wasting alot of time instead of just switching to gitpod and not practicing what I already kind of knew about Virtualenvs. And this is why my final project is now late for submission and just overrall rushed.

I swapped over to ATOM on my machine numerous times to try debug everything but still had the same issues.

Some modules not found because of venv.

The login page is tested throughout my tests as a number of my test operations require a logged in user.

All the error messages are working fine.

The registration page and logic are tested. I tested for mismatched passwords, duplicate user names, as well as successful registration.

The index page and reviews page is tested so that they load correctly. Some of my routes, reviews/ and my_account seem abit glitchy, sometimes they are speedy loading and other times they throw 404 errors.

@screen size 320px the jumbotron gets a little funky, but I guess thats the average screen size, not below.


## **Deployment**



## **Media & Resources**

Goodreads was what I was aiming for, maybe someday :) I really enjoy their site and app.

This was Inspiring

###This dude - who had the project before me,
I referred to his code quite abit, when I was unsure what way to do things.
I should've referenced the code but I never kept track of it, both projects are similiar.
His code is so well done it was good inspiration

Google images for the Jumbotron Image, I'm pretty sure it was pexel bay.

## **Future Notes**

I feel this didnt go as well as I would have liked or needed in this part of the course. But like my last project it will, or another one will be going for resubmission. I messed it up myself by trying to use other packages alongside what we had learned, instead of just keeping it simple with the Database.
